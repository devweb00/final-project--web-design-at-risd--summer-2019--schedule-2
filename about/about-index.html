<h2>About Andres Benites: </h2>

<p>My name is Andres Benites, I am a 21 year old Graphic Design Artist based in Chicago Illinois. I am currently a student at DePaul University where I am striving to finish a degree in User Experience Design with a minor in Graphic Design. I serve as the Historian and Founding Fathe for the Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity at DePaul University. I am also the founder of the DePaul Student Art page on Instagram. During the summer of 2017 I decided to take two 6-week courses at the Rhode Island School of Design. While at RISD I took an Introduction to Welding class as well as a Screen Printing class. This is where I really began to enjoy the world of graphic art and wanted to pursue a career in a creative field.
</p>


<p>
My skills include screen printing, apparel design, poster design, graphic design, social media and front end web development. I am currently searching to find my role in a professional setting, but this doesn't limit me to being creative everyday and being able to use my skills to impact the world around me.</p>

            <h2>RISD Summer 2019</h2>
            <p>I went to the Rhode Island School of Design in the summer of 2019 and took up courses in information design (and web design). I wanted to try a more hands-on approach to my learning, and so I left the journals and books behind for a month
                to focus on refining my design process and style.</p>
            <p>These are some of the things I managed to make during my time there!</p>

                    <h3>Overground</h3>
                    The first project for my Information Design class was a task to visualise three journeys of different lengths in one design, with a total of 45 points of data. I took inspiration from the London Underground's map to create a poster that could faithfully
                    convey information about geography and time despite not being to scale.

                    <h3>Peru</h3>
                    Another project in the Information Design course required us to make an infographic about an assigned country. The immense amount of information made the conceptualising process all the more important, and I went through several drafts before settling
                    on this accordion which tied individual sections together with a unified color scheme.

            <h2>Setting Sail</h2>
            <p>
                <i>Setting Sail</i> was the theme of Yale-NUS College's 2019 <a href="https://studentlife.yale-nus.edu.sg/orientation/">First-Year Orientation Programme</a>. As a member of the Orientation Committee, I spent the summer designing for the
                2-week programme.
            </p>
            <p>Orientation aimed to help new students adapt to a new academic, social and physical environment, and I felt that it needed consistent and cohesive designs throughout the event. What resulted was a clean, bold aesthetic accented by stripes
                that fit the nautical theme, with heavy usage of the logo, which was inspired by a sailor's tattoo.</p>
            <p>In hindsight, I realise I was essentially doing a branding campaign, and it turns out I quite like doing them!</p>

                    <h3>Orientation 2019 logo</h3>
                    Keeping with the nautical theme, I designed the logo to resemble classic "old-school" sailor tattoos. <br> Come to think of it, I may actually get this inked on myself one day.

                    <h3>First-Year Shirt</h3>
                    The shirts were designed to resemble a sailor's uniform - the arm stripes added a flair to an otherwise basic design, which allowed the shirt colors to stand out so important team members could be easily identified by the incoming class.

            <h2>Elm Logo Redesign</h2>
            <p>Elm College is a residential college in Yale-NUS, and is my current home. I had the opportunity to redesign Elm's logo for the new academic year. The tiger is the college's mascot, and I wanted to design a varsity-style logo that was striking
                and versatile.</p>

                    <h3>The Redesigned Logo</h3>
                    The drafts of this logo initially had much thinner lines, but one wrong click with Image Trace turned out to be a happy accident when the lines thickened and merged into a bold outline. Naturally I went with it and claimed that "I meant to do that".

            <h2>Student Associate Projects</h2>
            <p>There's never a shortage of events planned by Yale-NUS College's <a href="https://studentlife.yale-nus.edu.sg/dean-of-students/">Dean of Students office</a>, and with that comes a big need for publicity materials. As a Student Associate, I
                designed a variety of things, from posters and cards to entire booklets.</p>
            <p>The events held by the Dean of Students Office were but a fraction of the busy schedule in Yale-NUS, and there was a need for designs, whether publicity or informational, to stand out and yet remain clean and professional. Thus, a common recurring
                theme in these designs are strong colors and ample negative space, which could stand out from their surroundings and grasp the viewer's attention.</p>

                    Beach Plz is an annual beach party funded by the Dean of Students Office, and its organisers wanted a watercolour theme to fit in with the beach atmosphere, but were also planning to use the logo on a diverse range of canvases. Eventually we settled on
                    two designs that were aesthetically similar, but could be interchanged depending on the situation.

                    Valentine's Day at the Dean of Students Office is a time of appreciation, specifically for the staff and faculty who advise the student organisations in Yale-NUS. I designed this card based off the pun of "Nacho Average Student Org Advisor".

            <h2>Dish It!</h2>
            <p><i><a href="https://dishit.fun">Dish It!</a></i> was a dining hall feedback app that was born in my college suite during a particularly tumultuous period in the Yale-NUS dining experience. This was my first time doing front-end development
                on a web app (from scratch, not to mention), so you can imagine I was very proud of it when it successfully launched.</p>
            <p><i>Dish It!</i> operated for a couple semesters, and our users preferred its simple, intuitive and accessible design over the other feedback platforms available.</p>

                    <h3>The Dish It! Logo</h3>
                    The logo was designed to be the most elaborate visual of the app â€” that's how insistent we were on keeping things simple. It was versatile enough that I was able to create special logos on occasion (a la Google), which brought much life into the app.
